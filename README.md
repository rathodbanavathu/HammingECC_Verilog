# Hamming Code (Error Detection and Correction)

A Verilog design for **single-bit error detection and correction (SEC)** using Hamming codes.  
The encoder generates parity bits, and the decoder detects/corrects errors in the received data.

## Features
- Supports single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection.
- RTL modules for both **encoder** and **decoder**.
- Modular and synthesizable design.
- Verified with error-injected test vectors.
